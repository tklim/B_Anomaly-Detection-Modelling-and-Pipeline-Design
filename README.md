1. B_Anomaly Detection Modelling and Pipeline Design-LimTK.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook that can be executable but may be subject to error if there are versioning issues in Python.
2. B_Anomaly Detection Modelling and Pipeline Design-LimTK.pdf - The PDF file is available if you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Appendix_C_TimeSeriesKMean.ipynb - Testing on the TimeSeriesKMean Clusting Model This works, but is a bit tricky.
4. Appendix_C_TimeSeriesKMean.pdf
5. Appendix_D_AutoEncoder Tensorflow.ipynb - Testing on the AutoEncoder Tensorflow model This method works well.

Python packages tend of have conflict when testing too many different packages and modules. For example, tslearn and tensorflow uses differnt version of packages.
