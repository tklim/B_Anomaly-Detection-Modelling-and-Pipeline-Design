1. B_Anomaly Detection Modelling and Pipeline Design-LimTK.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook can be executed but may be subject to error if there are versioning issues in Python; hence, the PDF version is provided for each of viewing
2. B_Anomaly Detection Modelling and Pipeline Design-LimTK.pdf - The PDF file is available if you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Appendix_C_TimeSeriesKMean.ipynb - Testing on the TimeSeriesKMean Clustering Model This works, but is a bit tricky, as it seems like it requires more clusters to identify all the abnormal patterns.

5. Appendix_D_AutoEncoder Tensorflow.ipynb - Testing on the AutoEncoder Tensorflow model This method works. Setting the threshold has yet to be fully tested or fine-tuned.

Python packages tend to have conflicts when testing too many different packages and modules. For example, tslearn and tensorflow use different versions of packages.
